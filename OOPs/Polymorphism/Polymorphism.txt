Polymorphism have two types:
1. Compile time Polymorphism
2. Run time Polymorphism

-> In this type of polymorphism, function overloading and operator overloading are used.

2. Run time Polymorphism:
-> Run time polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism.
-> In this type of polymorphism, function overriding is used.


Polymorphism: 
-> overloading
-> overriding
